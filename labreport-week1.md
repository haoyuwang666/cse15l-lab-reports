## Step 2 *Remotely Connecting*
* First you need to get your course-specific account here: [link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). Change the password following instructions on website.
* Open a terminal in VScode (use the Terminal â†’ New Terminal menu option). Then type in `$ ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` with the "zz" replaced by your own cse15L course account. When you see messages:
```

RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
