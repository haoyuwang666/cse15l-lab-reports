# Lab-Report-Week3-Researching Commands
I choose to focus on 'grep' commands and did some research on it.
## Using '-r'/'--recursive'
* Description: Recursively searches files and directories.
* Source: [GNU Grep Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html#Recursive-Searching)
Example 1(Searching Files)
`grep -r "error" ./technical/`
Example 2(Searching Directories)
`grep -r "pattern" ./technical/`
